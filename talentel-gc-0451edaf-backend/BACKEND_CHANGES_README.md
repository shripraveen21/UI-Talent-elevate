## Issue Fixed: WebSocket Format Specifier Error

### Problem Description
The application was experiencing a critical WebSocket error that prevented the debug generation workflow from functioning:

```
ERROR:root:Error during WebSocket workflow: Invalid format specifier ' "additional1", "reason": "Why it's valuable"' for object of type 'str'
```

This error occurred in the `ProjectCreationWorkflow.py` file when Python tried to interpret JSON-like structures within f-strings as format specifiers.

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by unescaped curly braces `{}` in f-string literals that contained JSON schema examples. Python's f-string parser interpreted these braces as format specifiers rather than literal text.

### Files Modified

#### 1. ProjectCreationWorkflow.py
**File Path:** `ms1/app/Agents/DebugGen/ProjectCreationWorkflow.py`

**Changes Made:**

##### BRDAgent Class (Lines 53-63)
- **Issue:** Unescaped curly braces in JSON schema example within f-string
- **Fix:** Escaped all curly braces by doubling them (`{` → `{{`, `}` → `}}`)
- **Lines Modified:** 53-63

**Before:**
```python
system_message=f"""
...
{
    "brd": "BRD text here",
    "topics": ["topic1", "topic2", ...],
    "suggested_topics": [
        {"topic": "additional1", "reason": "Why it's valuable"},
        ...
    ]
}
...
"""
```

**After:**
```python
system_message=f"""
...
{{
    "brd": "BRD text here",
    "topics": ["topic1", "topic2", ...],
    "suggested_topics": [
        {{"topic": "additional1", "reason": "Why it's valuable"}},
        ...
    ]
}}
...
"""
```

##### CodeAgent Class (Lines 177-187)
- **Issue:** Unescaped curly braces in JSON schema example within f-string
- **Fix:** Escaped all curly braces by doubling them
- **Lines Modified:** 177-187

**Before:**
```python
{
    "files": {
        "src/main.py": "# code here",
        "src/utils.py": "# code here",
        ...
    }
}
```

**After:**
```python
{{
    "files": {{
        "src/main.py": "# code here",
        "src/utils.py": "# code here",
        ...
    }}
}}
```

### Technical Explanation
In Python f-strings, curly braces have special meaning for variable interpolation and formatting. When using literal curly braces (like in JSON examples), they must be escaped by doubling them:
- `{` becomes `{{`
- `}` becomes `}}`

This allows the f-string to render the literal braces without attempting to interpret them as format specifiers.

### Impact
- **Fixed:** WebSocket connection errors during debug generation workflow
- **Resolved:** Format specifier exceptions that prevented agent initialization
- **Improved:** Application stability and user experience

### Testing
- Verified Angular development server starts without compilation errors
- Confirmed WebSocket connections can be established
- Validated that the debug generation workflow can initialize properly

### Additional Notes
- The StructureAgent class did not require changes as it already used proper brace escaping
- No other f-string format specifier issues were found in the codebase
- The fix maintains backward compatibility and doesn't affect existing functionality
